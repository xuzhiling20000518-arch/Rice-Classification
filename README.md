# Rice-Classification
First, I pre-processed the dataset by replacing missing values and normalising the values. Second, I implemented and evaluated the performance of multiple classification algorithms: Logistic Regression,
Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Bagging, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting, using the stratified 10-fold cross-
validation method. Third, I applied grid search to find the best parameters for K-Nearest Neighbour,
Support Vector Machine and Random Forest.
